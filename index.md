Hello! I'm a software engineer from the Czech Republic.

With this blog, I hope to demonstrate a bit of how I think. I wanted to start a blog for years - someday. Then, in autumn 2023, I realized I have too high standards in mind for it and that an imperfect existent blog is better than a perfect, nonexistent one. That's why I write all my blogposts within one or two hours. Instead of high-quality elaborate pieces of brilliant structure and consise content, they're more of a recorded "stream of consciousness" on some topic. Hereâ€™s to hoping they will be of interest to you even so.
